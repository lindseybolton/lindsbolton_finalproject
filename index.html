            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Lindsey Bolton, and I am currently a Senior at the University of Iowa double majoring in Business Analytics and Leadership Management. I enjoy all things technology and hope to get into that industry someday as a Product Manager. In my free time, I enjoy watching new movies, baking, and getting outdoors whenever possible!</p>
